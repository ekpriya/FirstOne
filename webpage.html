		<p>Pre-master students have a maximum of two chances to pass a course. Within one semester two chances are offered. (In exeptional cases where a student uses the second attempt only in the next semester, this implies a ½ year study delay, with a max. of one year enrollment).
		When a student does not pass a course within two attempts, he/she will be excluded from the programme.</p>

		<p>All pre-master courses must be completed within one year. This is the maximum registration period in the pre-master’s programme.
		When a student does not pass all courses within one year, he/she will be excluded from the programme.</p>
